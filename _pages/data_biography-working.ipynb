    "The data that is being concluded would cover the KKK activities that happened in Colorado in the 1920s. It has included numerical data for the population of active members by the three ledgers. During that time the KKK was surprisingly influential in Colorado, even taking a role in state politics. In the ledgers, weâ€™re able to find details like names, addresses, and membership fees. Making us able to paint a picture of how the organization ran back then. Nowadays, History Colorado has digitalized these documents, making these data public for educational and informative usage. "

    "At first, when the KKK held most of the power in Colorado, these ledgers were put together in different parts of the state. Due to the popularity of the KKK back then, they have recorded most of their members in these books. After the KKK started to lose influence in the late 1920s, some ledgers went missing or stayed in peopleâ€™s private collections for many years. Eventually, History Colorado gathered as many as it could find and preserved them in the later part of the 20th century. The major push to digitize them happened more recently, in the 2010s, so that anyone could easily access these records online and learn about the history of the KKK in Colorado."

    "Local KKK leaders made these records to keep track of new members, list dues payments, and note each personâ€™s status; if they were in good standing. When History Colorado got these ledgers, archivists had to be very careful with them since some pages were torn or in poor shape. They cleaned and fixed the pages, placed them in protective covers, and stored them following professional archival rules. After that, they digitized the documents by scanning or photographing each page in high resolution. Staff and volunteers also created a partial index with basic details such as page numbers and dates to help people search the digital images. Lastly, History Colorado posted everything on their website so researchers, students, and the public could access them easily."

    "From the Klanâ€™s point of view, these ledgers were a straightforward way to handle money and track members in the 1920s. Keeping detailed accounts helped them stay organized, finance their activities, and gain political power. On the other hand, History Coloradoâ€™s main aim is different. By preserving and digitizing these documents, they offer an important firsthand look at the KKKâ€™s presence and impact at the local level. Historians can see how many people paid dues and took part, while people interested in family history might find surprising connections. More importantly, sharing these materials publicly helps us confront the history of racism and white supremacy. Even though these records can be uncomfortable, making them available gives a clearer view of how these harmful ideas shaped and still affect society."

Even though thereâ€™s no full transcription of every page yet, the site does have some search tools that help you find certain names or keywords.

    "Although these ledgers are critically important for researching the KKK, they are not exhaustive. Certain volumes appear to have been lost, such as address. This have leaved gaps in the historical record for specific towns or periods. Moreover, the handwritten entries can be difficult to interpret, which may result in transcription errors or incomplete digital indexes. The ledgers also focus primarily on individuals who formally paid dues, meaning that informal supporters or collaborators might be absent. In addition, appearing in a ledger does not necessarily clarify how an individual participated in the organizationâ€™s racist or antisemitic activities. Researchers must further account for ethical considerations, as identifying KKK members can raise privacy concerns or reopen painful family histories."

    "People reading or using these ledgers should remember that the KKK was a white supremacist group built on racism, xenophobia, and antisemitism. In 1920s Colorado, the Klan helped elect politicians and judges who then shaped laws and policies targeting Catholics, Jews, and Black communities. From a Data Feminism viewpoint, itâ€™s important to realize that the KKK collected data in a biased way, mainly focusing on money and memberships to push their hateful goals. Also, these records donâ€™t include the perspectives of those the Klan harmed. Knowing this bigger picture helps us see the ledgers as a starting point for deeper research, rather than the whole story on their own."
