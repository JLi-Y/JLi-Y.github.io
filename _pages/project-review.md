  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

This is my project review. It was written on {{ page.date }} and falls under the category of: {{ page.category }}.
My idea for the project review would be about the Chinese exclusion act that happened in 1882, however this topic does not have any journals or articles in the Journal of American History so I'm not sure if I'm able to do my project review about the Chinese Exclusion act.
