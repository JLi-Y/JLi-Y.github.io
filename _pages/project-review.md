Project written review

The research project that I chose to review is “The Chinese Question: From a Chinese Standpoint, How Print Media Has Been Used to Combat Discrimination.” This project analyzed the Chinese immigrant's migration timeline, the discrimination they have faced, and how they fight back against the discrimination. This research project includes both qualitative and quantitative data to analyze the written information. Overall this project has provided insightful findings related to the reasoning of migration and discrimination that Chinese have experienced.

The research begins with the cause of migration for the Chinese, for example in 1847 due to the opium war and the Taiping Rebellion one portion of the Chinese escaped from the war, and another portion of the Chinese was forced into the Coolie trade. This is where the migration started, even though at first a large number of them were brought to this land as laborers instead of trying to find a better life. Later on, it shows the role of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. economy, such as railroad construction workers, gold mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. Compared to other immigrants the Chinese did not engage in violent behavior or drunkenness, at the same time they took the heavy loads of work to boost the economy. However, the Chinese immigrants were still discriminated against by laws that were targeted at them, for example, The pigtail ordinance that forced the Chinese to cut off their traditional hairstyles, The Page Act that restricted the immigration of Chinese women, and The Chinese Exclusion Act that banned Chinese immigration.

This website is divided into clear sections and makes it easy for viewers to understand and keep on track. For example, it started with the back story and then moved into a topic describing how the Chinese were discriminated against; giving historical images of propaganda and cartoons. After the visual representation of discrimination, the authors went into detail on how these actions happened in real life, listing out the acts that were discriminating towards the Chinese. At last, the website provided pictures from a pamphlet that was written by Chinese merchants; about how Chinese should not face unfairness.
