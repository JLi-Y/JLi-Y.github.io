  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---
Project written review

The research project that I chose to review is “The Chinese Question: From a Chinese Standpoint, How Print Media Has Been Used to Combat Discrimination.” This project analyzed the Chinese immigrant's migration timeline, the discrimination they have faced, and how they fight back against the discrimination. This research project includes both qualitative and quantitative data to analyze the written information. Overall this project has provided insightful findings related to the reasoning of migration and discrimination that Chinese have experienced.
